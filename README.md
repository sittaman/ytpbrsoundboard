# YTPBR Soundboard

This project is a joke. It was created for the sole purpose of learning how to develop an Android app using PhoneGap.

My intention was to create an list of sound effects (like instants) used on brazilian "Youtube Poop" satiric videos and general memes as well. Most content is nasty and bizarre, but funny as hell if you catch the context.

Only code is available. Image and sound assets are too big and quite inappropriate to be here.

I owe a lot of kudos to @[tlhunter](https://github.com/tlhunter). Thanks to his project [Mobile Game Skeleton](https://github.com/PhobosRising/mobile-game-skeleton), I learnt a lot of stuff I put on this project, from better JavaScript coding to Design Patterns.
